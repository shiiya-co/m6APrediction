Description: Provides functions to predict N6-methyladenosine (m6A)
    modification sites in RNA using a pre-trained random forest model.
    The prediction is based on a set of features including sequence
    information (e.g., DNA 5mer) and other biological context (e.g.,
    RNA type, GC content).Final submission version.
